Student Career Guidance & Skill Recommendation System is a full-stack AI web application built using Flask, Machine Learning, and Google GenAI. It analyzes student skills from manual input or uploaded resumes to predict suitable career paths using a TF-IDF and Naive Bayes model. The system identifies skill gaps, calculates a career readiness score, and generates AI-based explanations and personalized learning roadmaps. It also includes secure login, an admin analytics dashboard, and a live MVP deployment for real-world demonstrations.
